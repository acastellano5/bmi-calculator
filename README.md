## Description
Welcome to my BMI Calculator! I built this BMI calculator using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. You decide whether you want to use the english system or metrics system when plugging in your units. Then, the calculator will tell you what your BMI is and it will tell you what category you're in. For example, if I am using the 
english system and I say that I am 5′ 7″ and weigh 157 lbs, my BMI would be 24.6 and I would be placed in the healthy category. I hope you enjoy my BMI calculator :)
